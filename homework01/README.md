My First Three Scripts 

The first script finds the five longest words in the words file by opening the file and then using the sort command to sort the words by length. Once sorted by length
the first five words print out. 

The second script uses the name module to print out five names of exactly nine charecters including the space. This was done by a for loop that would run five times to 
generate a name and then a nested while loop that would keep generating a name until it was nine charecters or less. 

The third script puts five names into a list and then uses a fucntion to to count the amount of charecters in each name. This script puts five names into a list and then
the function takes in a name and then returns its length after subtracting one charecter accounting for the space and then prints the name and the length of the name.
